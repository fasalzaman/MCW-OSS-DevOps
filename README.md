# OSS DevOps

Trey Research is an online vitamins seller that has a presence mainly in the United Kingdom and other countries/regions in Europe. They want to expand into other parts of the world starting with Asia and will soon be setting up distribution centers for their vitamins there. They have no retail stores; thus, all their business comes through their website. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is extremely important to them as is their user website experience with a heavy focus on availability and performance.

The company currently has two application teams: **Development** for their websites, and **Operations** for deployments and backend servers. These are all hosted in a commercial data center. The teams have a great deal of experience in application development in PHP and WordPress using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) and performing automated builds using Jenkins. What they lack is the operational expertise and maturity to maintain their applications properly. They struggle with development and design practices, deployments, configuration management, and scaling their application to meet busy seasonal periods.

# Abstract 


## Workshop

In this workshop, you will look at options for migrating an online health food supplier from a hosted environment to Azure that embraces modern DevOps tools using open-source software (OSS). You will investigate running OSS workloads using Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services that can leverage their existing knowledge of Jenkins.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and deploy  complex OSS workloads into Azure PaaS using Azure App Services as well as deployment and integration of Azure Marketplace products from Partners such as Bitnami for Jenkins, and update Azure App Services using providers such as GitHub.

## Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will design a plan for migrating a Linux based web application to Microsoft Azure using existing open-source software (OSS) skills such as Jenkins. This whiteboard design session will explore options for running Linux, such as virtual machines, or Azure PaaS services, such as Web Apps and Azure Database, for MySQL.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design solutions that use complex OSS workloads using Azure.

## Hands-on Lab
